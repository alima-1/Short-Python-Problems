Short-Python-Problem:
This repository is developed as i worked through the problems in the 
book "The Big Book of small Python Project" by Al Sweigart

How It Works:
Each directory in this repository represents a different problem 
from the book. I first attempt to solve each problem on my own.If 
needed i refer to the book for hints and othe resources to refine 
my solution. The scripts provided here reflect my approach to each 
problem.

Directory Structure:
Problem1/: Solution for Problem 1 from the book.
Problem2/: Solution for Problem 2 from the book.
...

How to Use:
Navigate to the directory of the problem your interested in and run
the script using python.

Acknowledgements:
